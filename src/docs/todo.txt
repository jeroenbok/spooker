	Spooker is an online Planning Poker application.

How does it work

	[Participants] can join a [estimation session] and bring out a [estimate].
	When all participants have estimated, a [estimate summary] is displayed.

	From here on, a new voting round starts.

Terms

	[Participant]
		A user, identified by [name]
	[Estimation round]
		A round of estimating.
	[Estimate]
		An estimate submitted by a participant in a estimation round.

Scenarios
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Joining a estimation round

		[x] As a [participant who has not joined an estimation round],
		    when I join an [estimation round] by entering my name,
		    then I join the running estimation round.
	
	Estimating

		[x] As a [participant],
		    I can [estimate] by entering my [estimated story points],
		    so that my estimate is taken into account in the [estimation round] for a user story.

		[x] As a [participant who has estimated] and [not all participants have yet estimated],
			when I reconsider on my estimate,
			then my estimate is taken into account
				everyone is notified of my new estimate
			so that I am not burdened to be 'right the first time'

	Seeing estimation round progress

		[x] As a [participant who has not estimated yet],
		    when another participant makes an estimation,
		    I want to see the number of estimates go up,
			so that I can see whether I should hurry up.

		[~] As a [participant who has estimated],
		    I can see which of the participants have estimated,
		       and whose estimates are pending -without seeing their actual estimate,
		    so that I can see which participants have decided on their estimate.

		[ ] As a [participant who has estimated],
		    when all participants have estimated,
		    I want to be able to join the next voting round.

	Seeing estimation round outcome

		[~] As a [participant],
		    I can see the estimates of all participants,
			so that as a group we can get consensus of the size of the user story.

Notes to self
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] when writing scenarios, scenarios are relevent within a context (e.g. screen)
[ ] describing scenarios in terms of user interaction with an interface helps to
    express at the right level of abstraction (acceptance)
[ ] we wrote some tests which aligned with acceptance tests, but feel that we
    might need to categorize these a little better and include acceptance tests too
