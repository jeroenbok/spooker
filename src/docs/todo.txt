	Joining a estimation round

		As a [participant], I can join an [estimation round] by entering my name,
		so I can participate in the planning.
	
	Estimating

		As a [participant], I can [estimate] by entering my [estimated story points],
		so that my estimate is taken into account in the [estimation round] for a user story.

	Seeing estimation round progress

		As a [participant], I can see which of the participants have estimated,
		and whose estimates are pending -without seeing their actual estimate,
		so that I can see which participants have decided on their estimate.

	Seeing estimation round outcome

		As a [participant], I can see the estimates of all participants,
		so that as a group we can get consensus of the size of the user story.
